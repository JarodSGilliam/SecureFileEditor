A good file editor makes a significant difference in terms of usability, portability, and productivity for many software developers. While large-scale editor projects, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, provide a plethora of additional features that some developers require, they can become bloated with an abundance of plugins and confusing project management. It is the goal of this team to develop a simple file/text editor focused on usability and convenience in the Rust language.

## V1

## V2

For the second release, we plan to focus on more advanced features such as the find/find and replace features, as well as various on-screen information such as displaying the name and type of the open file.
