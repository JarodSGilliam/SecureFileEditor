# SecureFileEditor
#### Created by Jarod Gillliam, Xin He, Hunter McGarity, and Chenqian Xu
A good file editor makes a significant difference in terms of usability, portability, and productivity for many software developers. While large-scale editor projects, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, provide a plethora of additional features that some developers require, they can become bloated with an abundance of plugins and confusing project management. It is the goal of this team to develop a simple file/text editor focused on usability and convenience in the Rust language.

# Docker Instructions (Release 1)
For the first release, we are simply aiming for a bash shell on container startup. The user will need to manually cd into the 'src' directory from here and then
run the program with "cargo run [filename]".

With Docker installed:
1) cd SecureFileEditor
2) "docker build -t [image_name] ."
    ex: "docker build -t file_editor ."
3) upon successful build, use "docker images" to see a list of all built images to ensure yours was built
4) "docker run -it [image_name]"
5) "cargo run text.txt" [other file names if applicable]

## V1
(Set to release 3/4/2022)
